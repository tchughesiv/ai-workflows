# Design Workflow Orchestrator

## Quick Start

1. If the user invoked a specific command (e.g., `/draft`, `/decompose`), read
   `commands/{command}.md` and follow it.
2. Otherwise, read `skills/controller.md` to load the workflow controller:
   - If the user provided a Jira issue key or URL, execute the `/ingest` phase
   - Otherwise, execute the first phase the user requests

If a step fails or produces unexpected output (e.g., Jira MCP errors, network
failures, codebase exploration failures), stop and report the error to the
user. Do not advance to the next phase. Offer to retry the failed step or
escalate.

For principles, hard limits, safety, quality, and escalation rules, see `guidelines.md`.
