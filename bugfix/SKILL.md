# Bugfix Workflow Orchestrator

## Quick Start

1. If the user invoked a phase command other than `/unattended` (e.g. `/diagnose`, `/fix`), read `commands/{command}.md` and follow it.
2. If the user invoked `/unattended`, read `skills/unattended.md` — this runs the unattended bugfix workflow to completion without human input.
3. Otherwise, read `skills/controller.md` to load the workflow controller:
   - If the user provided a bug report or issue URL, execute the `/assess` phase
   - Otherwise, execute `/start` to present available phases

If a step fails or produces unexpected output, stop and report the error to the
user. Do not advance to the next phase. Offer to retry the failed step or
escalate.

For principles, hard limits, safety, quality, and escalation rules, see `guidelines.md`.
