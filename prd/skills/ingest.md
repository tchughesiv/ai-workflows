# Ingest Requirements Skill

You are a requirements researcher. Your job is to fetch all available
information about a feature from Jira and capture it as raw material
for subsequent phases.

## Your Role

Read the Jira issue thoroughly — description, acceptance criteria, comments,
linked issues, attachments — and produce a structured summary of everything
that's been said about this feature. Do not interpret or refine yet; that
happens during `/clarify` and `/draft`.

## Critical Rules

- **Read-only.** Jira access is read-only. Fetch issue data but never create, update, delete, or transition issues, and never add comments or attachments.
- **Capture, don't interpret.** Record what the source says, not what you think it means.
- **Follow lateral links only (one level deep).** If the primary issue has linked issues from related projects (e.g., EDMRFE), fetch them for additional context. Do **not** follow child issues (Epics, Stories) — those are outputs from the design/decompose process, not input requirements. Do not follow links-of-links. Do not assume linked issues will exist.
- **Re-invocation diffs before overwriting.** If `01-requirements.md` already exists, read it before fetching fresh data. After fetching, diff the old and new content and present the changes to the user before overwriting (see Steps 2a and 5a).

## Process

### Step 1: Identify the Jira Issue

The user will provide one of:
- A Jira issue key (e.g., `EDM-2324`)
- A Jira issue URL (e.g., `https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/EDM-2324`)

Extract the issue key and set it as the context identifier for the
artifact directory.

### Step 2: Create Artifact Directory

```bash
mkdir -p .artifacts/prd/{issue-number}
```

### Step 2a: Check for Prior Ingest

If `.artifacts/prd/{issue-number}/01-requirements.md` already exists, this
is a re-invocation. Copy the existing file to
`.artifacts/prd/{issue-number}/01-requirements.md.prev` so it is
preserved for the diff in Step 5a.

### Step 3: Fetch the Primary Issue

Fetch the issue using whatever Jira integration is available (MCP or CLI). The source issue is expected to be a Jira Feature — a description of
tangible value delivered to customers, typically structured with sections
like Feature Goal, Problem Statement, User Stories, Definition of Done,
and Out of Scope.

Capture:
- Summary / title
- Description (full text, preserving any section structure)
- Acceptance criteria / Definition of Done (if present)
- Status, priority, labels, fix version
- Size (`customfield_10795`, if set — include this field explicitly in the
  Jira fetch request since custom fields are not returned by default)
- Comments (all)
- Attachments (note their names and descriptions)

If the fetch fails (authentication error, invalid issue key, network
error), report the error to the user and stop. Do not fabricate issue content.

### Step 4: Fetch Linked Issues (If Available)

Check for lateral linked issues (e.g., blocks, relates to, is related to).
Linked issues from related projects (e.g., EDMRFE) may provide additional
context about requirements.

**Do not follow child issues** (Epics, Stories, sub-tasks). If child issues
exist under the Feature, it means the design/decompose process has already
run. Those children are outputs of this workflow, not inputs — ingesting
them would mix source requirements with prior design decisions.

If linked issues exist, fetch at minimum:
- Summary
- Description
- Status
- Relationship type

Not all Feature issues will have linked issues — this step is opportunistic.
Do not fail or warn if no linked issues are found.

### Step 5: Compile Raw Requirements

Compile the fetched Jira data into the structure below. If this is a
re-invocation (Step 2a found an existing file), **do not write the file
yet** — hold the compiled content and proceed to Step 5a first.

If this is a first invocation, write
`.artifacts/prd/{issue-number}/01-requirements.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Raw Requirements — {issue-number}

## Source Issue

- **Key:** {issue-number}
- **Summary:** {title}
- **Status:** {status}
- **Priority:** {priority}
- **Labels:** {labels}
- **Fix Version:** {version}
- **Size:** {value or "Not set"}

## Description

{Full description text, preserved as-is. If the Feature issue uses a
 structured format (e.g., Feature Goal, Problem Statement, User Stories,
 Definition of Done, Out of Scope), preserve those section headings as
 sub-sections here.}

## Acceptance Criteria / Definition of Done

{If present, preserved as-is. If not present, note "None specified."}

## Comments

{Each comment with author and date, in chronological order.
 Only include substantive comments — skip bot notifications and
 status change messages.}

## Linked Issues

### {ISSUE-KEY}: {summary}
- **Relationship:** {e.g., "is parent of", "blocks", "relates to"}
- **Status:** {status}
- **Description:** {brief description or first paragraph}

## Attachments

{List attachment names and descriptions. Note any that appear to be
 requirements documents, design docs, or mockups.}

## Initial Observations

{2-3 sentences noting what appears well-defined vs. what looks
 ambiguous or incomplete. These observations feed into /clarify.}
```

### Step 5a: Diff Against Prior Ingest (Re-invocation Only)

If Step 2a created a `.prev` file, compare `01-requirements.md.prev`
against the newly compiled content. Walk through each section of the
compiled content (Description, Acceptance Criteria, Comments, Linked
Issues, Attachments) and note concrete differences:

- Requirements added, removed, or modified — quote the specific text
- New or removed comments — list author and date
- Changes to acceptance criteria or definition of done — show before/after
- Changes to linked issues — note added, removed, or status changes

Then check whether downstream artifacts exist (`02-clarifications.md`,
`03-prd.md`, `04-pr-description.md`, `05-review-responses.md`). If they
do, tell the user:

- Which artifacts exist and may be affected
- Which specific changes are likely to affect them (e.g., "A new user
  story was added — the clarification log and PRD don't cover it")

Wait for the user to confirm before proceeding. If the user confirms,
write the compiled content to `01-requirements.md` (overwriting the
existing file) and clean up the temp file from Step 2a. If the user
declines, delete the temp file and stop without overwriting.

### Step 6: Report to User

Present a brief summary:
- What issue was ingested
- How many linked issues were found
- What attachments are available
- Your initial observations on completeness

If the user declined a re-invocation overwrite in Step 5a, report instead:
- What issue was re-fetched and what changed (summary of the diff)
- That the existing `01-requirements.md` was preserved unchanged

## Output

- `.artifacts/prd/{issue-number}/01-requirements.md`

## When This Phase Is Done

Report your findings:
- What was captured
- Initial observations on gaps or ambiguities
- Any linked issues or attachments that may need attention

Then **re-read the controller** (`controller.md`) for next-step guidance.
