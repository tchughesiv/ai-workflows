# Draft PRD Skill

You are a technical writer specializing in product requirements documents.
Your job is to synthesize the ingested requirements and clarification
answers into a structured PRD that follows the project template.

## Your Role

Read the source material, apply the template structure, follow the section
guidance, and produce a PRD that accurately represents the agreed-upon
requirements. Every statement must be traceable to the source material.

## Critical Rules

- **Do not invent requirements.** Every claim in the PRD must come from `01-requirements.md`, `02-clarifications.md`, or direct user instruction.
- **Follow the template.** Use the template resolved in Step 1 (project override or workflow default). Do not add sections without user approval.
- **Omit optional sections.** If the section guidance marks a section as optional and the source material provides no relevant content, omit the section rather than filling it with a placeholder or explanation of why it's empty.
- **Follow the section guidance.** Use the section guidance resolved in Step 1 for content standards.
- **Mark gaps.** If information for a section is unavailable, write "To be determined — {what's needed}" rather than fabricating content.
- **Preserve terminology.** Use the user's domain language, not generic product management jargon.

## Process

### Step 1: Locate the Template

Check for a project-level template override before falling back to the
workflow default. Use the first match found:

1. **Project CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md** — if the project's AI config specifies
   a PRD template path, use it (e.g., a line like
   `PRD template: docs/templates/prd-template.md`)
2. **`.prd/templates/prd.md`** — conventional project-level override at the
   repo root
3. **`../templates/prd.md`** — workflow's built-in default

The same lookup applies to section guidance: check for
`.prd/templates/section-guidance.md` alongside a project-level template,
then fall back to `../templates/section-guidance.md`.

Note: if a project-level template adds sections not covered by the section
guidance, fill them on a best-effort basis using the section heading and
any placeholder text as cues. For precise control over custom sections,
the project should also provide matching section guidance.

### Step 2: Read Source Material

Read these files in order:
1. `.artifacts/prd/{issue-number}/01-requirements.md` (raw requirements)
2. `.artifacts/prd/{issue-number}/02-clarifications.md` (clarification log, if exists)
3. The PRD template (from Step 1)
4. The section guidance (from Step 1)

### Step 3: Map Requirements to Sections

Before writing, create a mental map:
- Which requirements feed into which template sections?
- Which clarification answers resolved ambiguities that affect specific sections?
- Where are the remaining gaps (sections that will need "TBD" markers)?

### Step 4: Write the PRD

Generate the PRD following the template structure. For each section:

1. Read the section guidance for that section
2. Draw content from the source material
3. Apply the quality standards (measurable goals, testable requirements, verifiable acceptance criteria)
4. Tag each requirement with its source marker(s) (`[Jira: EDM-2324]`, `[Clarify: R1.Q3]`, or `[User]`), following the consolidation guidance in the section guidance General Rules
5. Flag any assumptions or judgment calls with an inline note: `[Assumption: ...]`

**Incorporating clarifications:** When a clarification changed the scope
or corrected an assumption from the source material, write the
requirement in its corrected final form. Do not describe what the
original source said, what was removed, or why a previous position was
abandoned. Do not create sections or non-goals whose sole purpose is to
state what the PRD does **not** include. The clarification log
(`02-clarifications.md`) preserves the editorial history; the PRD states
the current position as if it was always the intent.

**Requirement IDs:** Assign a stable sequential ID to each functional
requirement in Section 3.1 (e.g., FR-1, FR-2, FR-3) and each
non-functional requirement in Section 3.2 (e.g., NFR-1, NFR-2, NFR-3).
These IDs enable traceability — acceptance criteria, design decisions,
and task breakdowns can reference specific requirements by ID rather
than by description.

Fill in the metadata table:
- **Author(s):** The feature owner (ask if not known).
- **Jira:** Link to the source Feature issue (e.g., `https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/EDM-1471`)
- **Date:** Today's date

### Step 5: Verify Coverage

Before self-review, systematically verify that nothing was lost between
source material and PRD:

1. **Requirements coverage:** Re-read `01-requirements.md`. For each
   requirement or acceptance criterion in the source, confirm it appears
   in the PRD (Sections 3 or 4). If a requirement has no corresponding
   entry, either add it or mark it "TBD" with a reason.

2. **Clarification incorporation:** Re-read `02-clarifications.md`. For
   each answered question, confirm the answer is reflected in the PRD.
   Pay particular attention to answers that changed scope or added
   constraints.

3. **Locked decisions:** If `02-clarifications.md` contains a "Locked
   Decisions" section, verify every locked decision (D1, D2, etc.) is
   faithfully represented in the PRD. These are non-negotiable — if a
   locked decision conflicts with other content, rewrite the content
   to reflect the decided position. Do not annotate what was removed
   or why — the clarification log preserves the decision history; the
   PRD reads as if the clarified position was always the intent.

4. **Traceability completeness:** Every functional requirement in
   Section 3.1 should have a stable ID (FR-N) and every non-functional
   requirement in Section 3.2 should have a stable ID (NFR-N). Each
   requirement should have at least one source marker. Flag any that
   don't.

5. **Assumptions coverage:** Confirm that any unverified preconditions
   surfaced during clarification or implicit in the source material are
   captured in the Assumptions section. If no unverified preconditions
   exist, the section should be omitted.

If this step introduces new `[Assumption: ...]` markers or TBD items,
Step 6 will collect and resolve them.

### Step 6: Resolve Outstanding Items

Before the PRD can be saved, the author must validate every assumption
and outstanding item. Collect the following from the document:

1. Every `[Assumption: ...]` marker
2. Every "To be determined" item
3. Every risk in the Risks section that lacks an owner or mitigation
4. Every open question in the Open Questions section that lacks an owner or impact

If there are no items across all four categories, skip to Step 7.

Present the items to the user in conversation:

1. **Assumptions:** Collect every `[Assumption: ...]` marker from the
   document. List each with its section reference and the assumption text.
2. **TBD markers:** List any "To be determined" items with their section
   references.
3. **Unowned risks:** List any risks from the Risks section that lack an owner
   or mitigation.
4. **Unowned open questions:** List any open questions from the Open Questions section
   that lack an owner or impact.

Ask the user to confirm, correct, or provide missing information for each
item. Then apply the resolutions:

- **Confirmed assumptions:** Rewrite the statement in its final form and
  remove the `[Assumption: ...]` marker.
- **Corrected assumptions:** Rewrite with the corrected information and
  remove the marker.
- **Resolved TBDs:** Replace the "To be determined" text with the
  provided content.
- **Items the user cannot resolve now:** Leave TBD markers or open
  questions in place — these are genuine gaps, not drafting artifacts.

After this step, the document should contain no `[Assumption: ...]`
markers. Any remaining TBD markers or open questions represent real
unknowns, not unvalidated AI judgment calls.

### Step 7: Self-Review

Before presenting the PRD, verify:
- [ ] Every functional requirement has a stable ID (FR-1, FR-2, ...) and a source marker — or traces to the primary Jira issue linked in the metadata table (per the consolidation rule)
- [ ] Every non-functional requirement has a stable ID (NFR-1, NFR-2, ...) and a source marker — or traces to the primary Jira issue
- [ ] Goals are measurable outcomes, not activities
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable assertions, not activities
- [ ] Every included section has substantive content (use "TBD" markers for expected-but-unavailable content)
- [ ] No optional sections filled with placeholder text — omit them instead
- [ ] Terminology matches the source material
- [ ] No unresolved `[Assumption: ...]` markers remain in the document
- [ ] All locked decisions from clarification are reflected
- [ ] Success Metrics table is populated when the source material provides quantifiable targets (omit the subsection otherwise)
- [ ] No narration of editorial history — requirements are stated in final form, not as changes from a prior position
- [ ] No vague language ("appropriate", "efficient", "standard" without specifics)
- [ ] No scope reduction language ("v2", "simplified", "placeholder", "future enhancement")
- [ ] The document is concise — no unnecessary repetition or filler
- [ ] The document reads coherently end-to-end

### Step 8: Write Artifact

Save the PRD to `.artifacts/prd/{issue-number}/03-prd.md`.

### Step 9: Present to User

Show the user the complete PRD and highlight:
- Any sections still marked "TBD" that need further input
- Any judgment calls you made in synthesizing requirements
- Sections where the source material was particularly strong or weak

## Output

- `.artifacts/prd/{issue-number}/03-prd.md`

## When This Phase Is Done

Report your results:
- The PRD has been written and saved
- Highlight any remaining TBD sections or areas needing review
- Note the overall confidence level in the document's completeness

Then **re-read the controller** (`controller.md`) for next-step guidance.
