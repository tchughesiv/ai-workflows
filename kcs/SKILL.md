# KCS Article Workflow Orchestrator

## Quick Start

1. If the user invoked a specific command (e.g. `/draft`, `/validate`), read `commands/{command}.md` and follow it.
2. Otherwise, read `skills/controller.md` to determine which phase to execute based on the user's input.

If a step fails or produces unexpected output, stop and report the error to the
user. Do not advance to the next phase. Offer to retry the failed step or
escalate.

For principles, hard limits, and quality rules, see `guidelines.md`.
