# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding assistants when working with this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains reusable AI coding workflows that can be installed globally or per-project in any environment (Cursor, Claude Code, Gemini). Each workflow is a self-contained directory with structured markdown files that AI agents can read and execute.

**Current workflows:**
- **ai-ready** — Codebase scanning and AGENTS.md generation (update)
- **bugfix** — Systematic bug resolution (assess, reproduce, diagnose, fix, test, review, document, pr)
- **docs-writer** — Documentation creation workflow
- **triage** — Bulk Jira bug triage with AI-driven categorization and HTML reports
- **skill-reviewer** — Meta-workflow that audits AI skill directories
- **cve-fix** — Automated CVE remediation from Jira tickets (start, patch, validate, pr, backport, close)
- **prd** — Requirements-to-PRD workflow (ingest, clarify, draft, revise, publish, respond)
- **design** — Design-and-decompose workflow (ingest, research, draft, decompose, revise, publish, respond, sync)
- **implement** — Story-to-code workflow (ingest, plan, revise, code, validate, publish, respond)
- **e2e** — Story-to-tests workflow for [QE] stories (ingest, plan, revise, code, validate, publish, respond)
- **code-review** — AI-driven code review with human-in-the-loop decisions (start, continue, clean)
- **kcs** — KCS Solution article workflow (gather, draft, validate, handoff)

## Architecture

### Workflow Structure

Every workflow follows this canonical structure:

```text
workflow-name/
  SKILL.md              # Entry point with YAML frontmatter (name, description)
  guidelines.md         # Behavioral rules: principles, hard limits, safety, quality
  README.md             # Human-readable documentation
  skills/
    controller.md       # Optional phase dispatcher
    phase-name.md       # Implementation for each phase
  commands/
    phase-name.md       # Thin wrappers that invoke controller or SKILL.md
  scripts/              # Optional — deterministic operations invoked by skills
  prompts/              # Optional — prompt templates for sub-agent delegation
```

**Key architectural principles:**
1. **Auto-discovery**: Any directory with `SKILL.md` is automatically discovered by the installer
2. **Progressive disclosure**: SKILL.md is thin (under 30 lines), details live in guidelines.md and skills/
3. **Relative paths**: All file references must be relative to the file's location (for symlink compatibility)
4. **Phase-based execution**: Most workflows operate through discrete phases with explicit transitions
5. **Shared resources**: Cross-cutting concerns live in `_shared/` and are referenced by relative path from workflow skills

### Shared Resources (`_shared/`)

Cross-cutting concerns that multiple workflows need are extracted into
`_shared/` to avoid duplication and ensure consistency:

```text
_shared/
  review-protocol.md              # Evaluation criteria, finding format, severity definitions
  recipes/
    self-review-gate.md           # Self-review quality gate for pre-PR code review
```

**Review protocol** (`review-protocol.md`): Defines the shared evaluation
criteria (correctness, error handling, security, performance, naming, test
coverage, conventions), finding format, severity definitions, and validation
rules used by the standalone `code-review` workflow and the self-review gates
embedded in all code-changing workflows.

**Recipes** (`recipes/`): Self-contained, parameterized procedures that
workflows reference at specific points. Each recipe has a Parameters section
defining what the calling skill must provide, followed by the complete
procedure. Recipes are referenced via relative path from the calling skill
(e.g., `../../_shared/recipes/self-review-gate.md` from `workflow/skills/`).

**Self-review gate** (`recipes/self-review-gate.md`): A quality gate that
reviews code changes before they are pushed or submitted as a PR. Discovers
the project's preferred non-interactive review tool from AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md;
if none is specified, performs a structured self-review using the shared review
protocol. Strongest at catching mechanical issues (convention violations,
obvious bugs, inconsistencies); not a substitute for independent review.
Used by bugfix `/pr`, implement `/publish`, e2e `/publish`, and cve-fix `/pr`.

### File Reference Conventions

Critical for symlink resolution:
- `commands/*.md` reference `../skills/controller.md` (if workflow has a controller) or `../SKILL.md` (for workflows without a controller) or `../skills/phase-name.md` (direct phase reference)
- `skills/controller.md` (when present) references sibling skills as `phase-name.md` (not `skills/phase-name.md`)
- `SKILL.md` references `guidelines.md` and optionally `skills/controller.md` (same directory)

### Artifact Management

Workflows write outputs to `.artifacts/{workflow-name}/{context}/`:
- **ai-ready**: No persistent artifacts (writes directly to the target project's AGENTS.md)
- **bugfix**: `.artifacts/bugfix/{issue-number}/` (root-cause.md, reproduction.md, etc.)
- **code-review**: `.artifacts/code-review/{branch}/` (00-reviewer-profile.md, 01-change-summary.md, code-review-{NNN}.md, review-response-{NNN}.md, review-metadata.json, decisions-{NNN}.json)
- **triage**: `.artifacts/triage/{project}/` (issues.json, analyzed.json, report.html)
- **skill-reviewer**: `.artifacts/skill-reviewer/{skill-name}/` (file-hashes.json, skill-map.md, review.md)
- **cve-fix**: `.artifacts/cve-fix/{context}/` (context.md, patch-log.md, validation-results.md, pr-description.md, backport-log.md, close-report.md)
- **prd**: `.artifacts/prd/{issue-number}/` (01-requirements.md, 02-clarifications.md, 03-prd.md, 04-pr-description.md, 05-review-responses.md)
- **design**: `.artifacts/design/{issue-number}/` (01-context.md, 02-research.md, 03-design.md, 04-epics.md, 05-stories/epic-{N}-{slug}.md, 05-stories/epic-{N}/story-{NN}-{slug}.md, 06-coverage.md, 07-pr-description.md, 08-review-responses.md, publish-metadata.json, sync-manifest.json)
- **implement**: `.artifacts/implement/{jira-key}/` (01-context.md, 02-plan.md, 03-test-report.md, 04-impl-report.md, 05-validation-report.md, 06-pr-description.md, 07-review-responses.md, publish-metadata.json)
- **e2e**: `.artifacts/e2e/{jira-key}/` (01-context.md, 02-plan.md, 03-test-report.md, 04-impl-report.md, 05-validation-report.md, 06-pr-description.md, 07-review-responses.md, publish-metadata.json)
- **kcs**: `.artifacts/kcs/{issue-key}/` (01-context.md, 02-kcs-draft.md, 03-handoff-message.md)

## Prerequisites

### Required for All Workflows
- Git (for version control operations)

### Workflow-Specific Dependencies
- **ai-ready**: None (reads codebase, writes AGENTS.md)
- **bugfix**: GitHub CLI (`gh`) — for PR queries and creation
- **code-review**: None (operates on local uncommitted changes; optionally uses project's lint/test commands if discoverable)
- **triage**: Jira MCP server — configured and authenticated for Jira API access
- **docs-writer**: GitLab CLI — for merge request creation (or GitHub CLI for GitHub-hosted projects)
- **cve-fix**: Jira MCP server or Jira CLI (`jira`), GitHub CLI (`gh`), optionally `skopeo` for container image verification
- **prd**: Jira MCP server — for requirements ingestion; GitHub CLI (`gh`) — for PR creation and review comment management
- **design**: Jira MCP server or CLI — for `/ingest` (read-only) and `/sync` (creates epics/stories); GitHub CLI (`gh`) — for `/publish` and `/respond`; web search and URL fetching — for `/research` (conditional)
- **implement**: Jira MCP server or CLI — for `/ingest` (read-only); GitHub CLI (`gh`) — for `/publish` and `/respond`; project build/test/lint tooling (discovered during `/ingest`); docs repo (local clone) — for `/ingest` (reads PRD and design document)
- **e2e**: Jira MCP server or CLI — for `/ingest` (read-only); GitHub CLI (`gh`) — for `/publish` and `/respond`; project e2e test tooling (discovered during `/ingest`); docs repo (local clone) — for `/ingest` (reads PRD and design document)
- **kcs**: Jira MCP server — for `/gather` (read-only)

## Installation System

### install.sh

The installer uses auto-discovery to find all workflows and creates symlinks:

```bash
# User-level (all workflows)
./install.sh cursor                    # ~/.cursor/skills/
./install.sh claude                    # ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md and ~/.claude/skills/
./install.sh gemini                    # ~/.gemini/skills/
./install.sh all                       # All environments

# Selective workflows
./install.sh cursor --workflows bugfix,triage

# Project-level
./install.sh cursor --project /path/to/proj    # .cursor/skills/
./install.sh claude --project /path/to/proj    # .claude/CLAUDE.md and .claude/skills/
```

**Auto-discovery mechanism**: The script scans for `*/SKILL.md` files at repo root. No script changes needed when adding workflows.

### uninstall.sh

Mirrors install.sh structure with removal logic.

### Claude Code Integration

For Claude Code, the installer:
1. Appends workflow references to `CLAUDE.md` (or `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for project-level) beneath the `# ai-workflows` marker
2. Symlinks workflows into `~/.claude/skills/` (or `.claude/skills/` for project-level) for slash command discovery
3. Removes stale references (old controller.md paths) to avoid duplicates

## Development Workflows

For detailed workflow development guidelines (structure, file conventions, testing), see CONTRIBUTING.md.

**Quick reference:**
- New workflow: Create directory with SKILL.md, run `./install.sh --list` to verify auto-discovery
- Modify workflow: Maintain relative paths, use progressive disclosure, run skill-reviewer for validation
- Test: `./install.sh cursor && ./uninstall.sh` for clean reinstall verification

## Workflow-Specific Notes

### ai-ready

- Single-phase workflow: `/update` scans the codebase and writes AGENTS.md
- No external dependencies or artifacts
- Safe for any project — reads only, writes one file

### bugfix

- `/pr` includes a self-review gate (`_shared/recipes/self-review-gate.md`) that reviews uncommitted changes before committing — discovers the project's review tool or falls back to the shared review protocol
- Unattended mode available: `skills/unattended.md` (chains diagnose → fix → test → review)
- Uses git commands extensively (blame, log, status, diff)
- Creates regression tests during `/test` phase
- Integrates with GitHub CLI for PR creation

### code-review

- Review evaluation criteria are defined in `_shared/review-protocol.md` (shared with the self-review gates in other workflows)
- No external dependencies — operates entirely on local uncommitted changes
- Discovery-based: reads AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, linting configs, CI workflows to build a reviewer profile automatically
- Human-in-the-loop by default: every finding is presented for user decision before any code changes
- Unattended mode available (`--unattended`): auto-implements, iterates until approved, presents summary at end
- The implementor independently assesses each reviewer finding and may disagree
- Supports optional focus guidance (e.g., `/start focus on error handling`)
- When subagents are available, the reviewer runs in a separate context for independence; when not, uses sequential review with file-based handoff
- Automatic cleanup on approval — no manual `/clean` needed for completed reviews
- `/clean` exists only for abandoned reviews that were started but never finished

### triage

- Requires Jira MCP server configured and authenticated
- Generates self-contained HTML reports with Material Design styling
- Read-only: never modifies Jira issues
- `/assess` is for single-issue triage (not part of bulk pipeline)
- Recently resolved bugs fetched for regression matching

### skill-reviewer

- Single-phase workflow (no controller)
- Read-only review (fixing findings is separate from review phase)
- Must read all files in target skill before forming opinions
- Runs `scripts/pre-review-checks.py` for automated structural, frontmatter, reference, and sequencing checks before LLM evaluation
- For large skills (15+ files), delegates initial reading to an Explore sub-agent using `prompts/analyze-skill.md`, which produces a skill map at `.artifacts/skill-reviewer/{skill-name}/skill-map.md`

### docs-writer

- Converts Jira tickets or GitHub issues into AsciiDoc documentation
- Runs Vale for style compliance before applying changes
- Creates GitLab merge requests (designed for GitLab-hosted docs repos, adaptable to GitHub with gh CLI)
- Must get user approval after `/plan` phase before proceeding to `/draft`

### cve-fix

- `/pr` includes a self-review gate (`_shared/recipes/self-review-gate.md`) that reviews dependency changes before committing — discovers the project's review tool or falls back to the shared review protocol
- Requires Jira MCP server or CLI for ticket research
- Only `/close` writes to Jira (all other phases are read-only)
- `/backport` is optional and repeatable for multiple release branches
- Container image verification via `skopeo` is optional
- Multi-strategy patching tries fixes in ascending risk order (direct → transitive → override → major)

### prd

- Requires Jira MCP server for requirements ingestion (read-only — never modifies Jira)
- Uses GitHub CLI (`gh`) for PR creation and review comment management
- `/clarify` has explicit exit criteria and is re-entrant (can loop back from `/draft`)
- `/respond` requires user approval before posting any PR comments
- PRD template and section guidance live in `templates/` (not embedded in skills)
- Must get user review after `/draft` before proceeding to `/publish`

### design

- Requires a completed PRD (`.artifacts/prd/{issue-number}/03-prd.md`) as input
- Jira is read-only until `/sync`; only `/sync` creates issues, and only with dry-run + explicit approval
- Design and decomposition co-evolve — changes to the design flag the decomposition for regeneration, and decomposition gaps recommend revising the design
- Shares docs repo config with PRD workflow (`.artifacts/prd/config.json`)
- Design doc template and section guidance live in `templates/` with project-level override support
- Each story must include functionality AND testing (no deferred test stories)

### implement

- `/publish` includes a self-review gate (`_shared/recipes/self-review-gate.md`) that reviews branch changes before pushing — discovers the project's review tool or falls back to the shared review protocol
- Requires a Jira Story (typically created by the design workflow's `/sync` phase) as input
- Jira is read-only — no phase in this workflow writes to Jira
- Discovery-based validation: build, test, lint, and coverage commands are discovered during `/ingest` from the project's AGENTS.md, Makefile, and CI workflows — not hardcoded
- Contract-based testing: tests validate behavioral contracts through public interfaces; unit tests always required, integration tests required when the story touches component interactions
- Incremental commits prefixed with Jira key — no squashing, each commit independently meaningful for backporting
- Plan evolves during implementation — `02-plan.md` is updated as tasks complete, enabling resumption after interruptions
- Code changes happen in the source repo on a feature branch; `/publish` creates a PR in the source repo (not a separate docs repo)

### e2e

- `/publish` includes a self-review gate (`_shared/recipes/self-review-gate.md`) that reviews branch changes before pushing — discovers the project's review tool or falls back to the shared review protocol
- Requires a Jira [QE] Story (typically created by the design workflow's `/sync` phase) as input
- Jira is read-only — no phase in this workflow writes to Jira
- Discovery-based infrastructure: e2e test framework, test infrastructure abstractions (harness, fixtures, page objects, helpers — whatever the project uses), auxiliary services (if any), execution commands, and conventions are discovered during `/ingest` — not hardcoded
- Reference suite pattern: before writing tests, identifies the most similar existing e2e test suite and extracts its patterns (imports, lifecycle hooks, test infrastructure usage, assertions, labels)
- Scenario-driven planning: each acceptance criterion maps to concrete test scenarios with specific test grouping, steps, assertions, and labels
- Anti-pattern detection during `/validate`: checks for hardcoded sleeps, brittle selectors, order-dependent tests, shared mutable state, missing cleanup, test infrastructure bypass, missing labels, hardcoded values, missing async polling, missing failure diagnostics
- Feature defects are not test bugs — if tests reveal a defect in the [DEV] implementation, the test is adjusted (xfail/skip) and the defect is noted in the implementation report
- Plan evolves during implementation — `02-plan.md` is updated as tasks complete, enabling resumption after interruptions
- Code changes happen in the source repo on a feature branch; `/publish` creates a PR in the source repo

### kcs

- Requires Jira MCP server for `/gather` (read-only — never modifies Jira)
- Produces KCS Solution articles in markdown following the KCS Content Standard
- Article template, section guidance, and validation checklist live in `templates/`
- `/validate` checks the draft against a structured checklist and fixes violations inline
- `/handoff` composes a channel-agnostic message for the support engineer
- Must get user confirmation between phases; all `/validate` blockers must be resolved before `/handoff`

## Common Commands

**Note**: This repository contains AI workflow definitions (markdown files), not traditional code requiring build/test commands. "Testing" refers to verifying workflow execution and symlink installation.

### Installation
```bash
./install.sh all                           # Install all workflows, all environments
./install.sh cursor --workflows bugfix     # Install specific workflow
./install.sh --list                        # List available workflows
./uninstall.sh cursor                      # Remove Cursor installation

# Verify installation
ls -la ~/.cursor/skills/                   # Check Cursor symlinks
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/                   # Check Claude Code symlinks
cat ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md                    # Verify Claude Code references
```

### Git Workflow
```bash
git status                                 # Check staged changes
git diff                                   # Review changes
git log --oneline -10                      # Recent commits
git blame <file>                           # Trace file history
```

### GitHub CLI (for bugfix)
```bash
gh pr list --state open
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."
gh pr view 123
gh issue view <num> --repo <owner/repo>    # For docs-writer
gh pr diff <num> --repo <owner/repo>       # For docs-writer
```

### Jira MCP (for triage, docs-writer, prd, design, kcs)
```bash
# Invoked via MCP tools, not CLI directly
# Example JQL: "project = EDM AND issuetype = Bug AND resolution = Unresolved"
```

### Vale (for docs-writer)
```bash
vale path/to/file.adoc    # Style/terminology validation
```

## Key Constraints

1. **No IDE-specific syntax**: All workflow content is plain markdown
2. **Relative paths only**: For symlink compatibility across install scopes
3. **Progressive disclosure**: SKILL.md stays under 30 lines
4. **No auto-advance in attended mode**: Workflows wait for user input between phases unless an explicit unattended mode is documented for that workflow
5. **Artifact persistence**: All significant outputs saved to .artifacts/
6. **Read-only reviews**: skill-reviewer never modifies target skill files during review

```

## Path to Production

When a workflow invokes commands that could affect shared systems:
- **Git operations**: Always verify with `git status` before destructive operations
- **PR/MR creation**: Confirm branch and base before pushing (bugfix uses GitHub, docs-writer uses GitLab)
- **Jira queries**: Triage is read-only, but always confirm project key before bulk operations
- **Documentation changes**: Run Vale validation before applying changes to repository files (docs-writer)
