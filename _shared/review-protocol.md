# Code Review Protocol

Shared evaluation criteria, finding format, and assessment model used by all
code review activities in this repository — both the standalone `code-review`
workflow and the self-review gates embedded in other workflows.

## Core Principles

- **Challenge decisions, not just implementation.** Don't just verify that
  the code does what it intends — question whether the intent is right.
  Should this abstraction exist? Is this the right boundary between
  components? Would a different approach avoid the complexity being managed
  here? A review that only checks correctness is a linter with extra steps.
- **Review what the developer wrote, not what you would have written.** The
  above principle challenges decisions; this one constrains how. Evaluate
  the approach on its merits — does it work, is it clear, is it safe? Do
  not impose stylistic preferences or rewrite working code in your preferred
  idiom. Challenge the design, not the taste.
- **Findings must be actionable.** Every finding must include a concrete
  suggestion the developer can evaluate and apply. Vague observations
  ("consider improving this") are not findings.
- **Severity must be honest.** CRITICAL and HIGH are blockers that would cause
  bugs, security issues, or maintenance problems. MEDIUM and LOW are suggestions
  that improve quality but are not blocking. Inflating severity erodes trust;
  deflating it hides real problems.
- **Assess on value, not severity.** A LOW finding that genuinely improves the
  code (clearer naming, better readability, a small correctness improvement) is
  worth implementing. A MEDIUM finding that doesn't add real value (stylistic
  preference, churn without improvement) is not. Severity indicates impact;
  value determines whether the finding is worth acting on.
- **Discover, don't assume.** The project's tech stack, conventions, and quality
  standards are discovered from the codebase, not hardcoded. Every project gets
  a review tailored to its own standards.

## Evaluation Criteria

Evaluate changes against these categories, prioritized by impact:

1. **Correctness** — Does the code do what it intends? Are there logic errors,
   off-by-one mistakes, or unhandled edge cases?
2. **Error handling** — Are errors caught, propagated, and reported
   appropriately? Are failure modes handled?
3. **Security** — Are there injection risks, unsafe operations, exposed secrets,
   or other OWASP-category concerns?
4. **Design** — Does each new abstraction earn its complexity? Are
   responsibilities clearly divided — no god functions, no single type
   accumulating unrelated concerns? Do interfaces hide implementation details
   and expose coherent contracts? Are there implicit assumptions between
   components that should be explicit (shared constants, expected call order,
   assumed preconditions)? Signals: a function taking many parameters
   (missing intermediate type), a type importing from several unrelated
   packages (mixed concerns), identical error-handling blocks repeated
   across call sites (missing shared helper), a new interface that exposes
   internal types to callers.
5. **Performance** — Are there unnecessary allocations, N+1 queries, unbounded
   operations, or other efficiency concerns?
6. **Naming and clarity** — Are names descriptive? Is the intent clear from
   reading the code?
7. **Test coverage** — Are the changes tested? Are edge cases covered? Are
   tests testing contracts, not implementation?
8. **Project conventions** — Do the changes follow the conventions discovered
   from the project's AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, linting configs, and contribution
   guidelines?

## Finding Format

Each finding must include:

- **File:** The file path
- **Location:** Line range or function name
- **Severity:** CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
- **Category:** One of the evaluation criteria above
- **Issue:** What the problem is
- **Suggestion:** Concrete, actionable fix

Findings that cannot cite a specific file and location in the actual diff must
be discarded — they indicate hallucinated references.

## Severity Definitions

| Severity | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| CRITICAL | Would cause bugs, security vulnerabilities, or data loss in production | Must fix before merge |
| HIGH | Missing error handling, race conditions, incomplete coverage that could cause failures | Should fix before merge |
| MEDIUM | Naming improvements, minor edge cases, convention violations | Fix if it adds value |
| LOW | Readability suggestions, minor refactoring opportunities | Fix only if clearly valuable |

## Validation Rules

After obtaining a review (whether from a subagent, external tool, or inline
review), validate every finding:

1. **Verify file references.** Confirm the cited file exists and was part of
   the changes under review.
2. **Verify location references.** Confirm the cited line range or function
   exists in the current version of the file.
3. **Discard hallucinated findings.** If a finding references a file or
   location that does not exist, discard it silently. Do not present it.
4. **Read surrounding context.** The diff shows what changed; the surrounding
   code reveals whether the change fits. Read full files around changed
   sections to understand context.
